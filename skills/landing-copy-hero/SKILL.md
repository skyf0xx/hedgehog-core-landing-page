description: Use whenever `landing-copywriter` drafts the section directly beneath the locked headline — the subhead/lede that makes the headline's claim credible. Trigger when the section's role is "hero support" in `landing-sequencer`'s list, distinct from the headline itself (`landing-copy-headline`) or the problem/agitation section (`landing-copy-problem`).

# Landing Copy: Hero (subhead/lede)

The hero section's job is narrow: make the headline's claim credible in
one breath, before the reader has committed to reading further. It is not
the place to make the full case — that's every section after it. A hero
section that tries to argue, prove, or handle objections has taken on a
different section's job.

This skill covers the section immediately beneath the locked headline
only. The headline itself is `landing-headline-writer`'s
`landing-copy-headline` skill.

## What this section answers

One question, in this order:

1. **What is the mechanism, named plainly?** The headline led with the
   outcome and deliberately withheld the mechanism (per
   `landing-copy-headline`'s outcome-subject test) — this section is
   where that mechanism gets named, in plain language, for the first
   time.
2. **Why should the reader believe the headline's claim is achievable,
   not aspirational?** One line of credibility, not a proof point (proof
   points belong to `landing-copy-proof`) — a plain statement of how the
   mechanism gets the reader from their current state to the headline's
   promise.

## The algorithm

Per this core's fixed paragraph algorithm (`landing-copywriter`'s own
file): this section's paragraph count is set by however many beats
`landing-sequencer` assigned it, almost always 1 (a hero is rarely a
multi-beat section). Within that single paragraph:

1. **Sentence 1 — name the mechanism.** Plain verb, plain noun. No
   abstraction standing in for the thing itself (the same plain-verb
   discipline `landing-strategist` applies at the subject-statement
   stage).
2. **Sentence 2 (only if the beat has room) — the credibility bridge.**
   One sentence connecting the mechanism to the headline's promise: how
   doing this thing gets the reader that outcome. Not evidence, not a
   number — that's `landing-copy-proof`'s job — just the logical link
   made explicit.

Two sentences is the ceiling for a single-beat hero. If it's taking a
third sentence to make the mechanism credible, the mechanism itself is
underspecified — flag it back rather than padding the section to compensate.

## Writing standard (this section's delta from `landing-copywriter`'s full standard)

- **No proof, no numbers, no named evidence here.** A stat or case study
  in the hero section is `landing-copy-proof`'s content pulled forward —
  redirect it downstream, keep this section to the plain claim.
- **No objection-handling here.** "But you might be wondering..." belongs
  to `landing-copy-objection`, not this section.
- Match the token system's CTA styling intent only if this section
  carries a CTA (rare — most builds put the CTA in `landing-copy-cta`'s
  section instead).

## Self-test

- The mechanism is named in plain language, not gestured at.
- Paragraph count matches the beat count `landing-sequencer` assigned —
  1 paragraph for a single beat, not padded to 2 for weight.
- Read against the locked headline: does this section make the headline
  more believable, or does it just restate the headline in different
  words? Restating fails this test.

## Constraints

- Never draft the headline itself — that's `landing-copy-headline`,
  already locked before this section starts.
- Never pull proof points, stats, or objection-handling into this
  section to make it feel more substantial — a thin hero section is
  correct; padding it borrows from a downstream section's job.
