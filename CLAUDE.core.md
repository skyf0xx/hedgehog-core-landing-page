## This project's core: landing-page

The Chain Method: brief → feeling → tokens/element → sequence →
artifact, where every visual choice traces back to a sentence that
caused it. No domain data, no backend — a single (or few-page) marketing
site, built once through a fixed pipeline rather than iterated on
freely. See `.hedgehog/BMAD/` for the vendored BMAD-METHOD shelf's raw
output and `.hedgehog/chain/` for this core's own archival planning
intake output — the Strategist's subject statement, the adjective/note
tables, and the token system, written once by `planner` and the pipeline
agents, never edited after a phase closes.

The Chain Method decides *what* the signature element is and *why* it's
there — sourced from the subject statement, audited for traceability.
`landing-shapes` decides *how* to build it and every other section
shape, divider, or icon — the concrete CSS/canvas techniques and the
pinned icon source. Neither restates the other's decision.

### The skills — invoke these, don't improvise

- **`hedgehog-landing-loop`** — every unit of work once bootstrapped:
  `hedgehog next` emits the packet for one ready compiled layer, run the
  fine-grained Chain Method phases it bundles through their owning
  agents, gate the layer via `hedgehog verify`, which commits it on a
  pass. Also holds the Correction Protocol for fixing a wrong upstream
  phase (e.g. a signature element that doesn't trace back to the subject
  statement). Invoke it at the start of any build session and for
  "what's next".
- **`hedgehog-bootstrap-landing-page-core`** — run **once**, at project
  start, to land the pre-verified Astro + Tailwind workspace. Skip if
  `astro.config.mjs` already exists.
- **`landing-shapes`** — the shape/divider/icon construction library:
  geometry personality, curve and angular CSS/canvas techniques, and
  Lucide as the pinned icon source. `landing-systems` points into it
  when naming the signature element's family; `landing-sequencer` and
  `landing-builder` invoke it for the concrete recipe.
- **`landing-copy-headline`, `landing-copy-hero`, `landing-copy-problem`,
  `landing-copy-mechanism`, `landing-copy-proof`, `landing-copy-objection`,
  `landing-copy-cta`** — the per-archetype copywriting algorithms: what
  question each section type answers, what order to answer it in, and its
  own self-test. `landing-headline-writer` invokes `landing-copy-headline`
  for the headline; `landing-copywriter` invokes whichever of the other
  six matches the section's role, as assigned by `landing-sequencer`.
- **`conventional-commits`** — when a change spans several phases in one
  working-tree pass and needs splitting back into per-phase commits
  (mainly Correction Protocol cleanups).

### The agents — delegate the judgment calls

- **`planner`** — planning intake (which core applies, then this core's
  own brief intake: the vendored BMAD-METHOD shelf, run in full and
  mined into subject, audience, single page job) at project start. Writes
  the `landing` intent (`hedgehog intent add`, one call — this core has
  no module axis), `.hedgehog/BMAD/`, and `.hedgehog/chain/00-brief.md`.
  On first run, hands off to the `bootstrap` agent once Confirm & Lock
  holds. This core has no module axis for a later `planner` run to add an
  intent to, so new scope after the build is complete doesn't return to
  `planner` at all: a new section on a page whose subject, audience, and
  job are unchanged (`.hedgehog/chain/00-brief.md` still holds) is
  additive work inside the existing chain, routed to
  `hedgehog-landing-loop`'s Correction Protocol post-build entry instead.
  A different subject, audience, or job is a different page and belongs
  in its own landing-page project; `00-brief.md` is never rewritten to
  fit new scope, since it's the root every phase's traceability audit
  walks back to.
- **`bootstrap`** — runs `hedgehog-bootstrap-landing-page-core`'s steps.
  Triggered automatically by `planner` after its first run; skip if
  `astro.config.mjs` already exists.
- **`landing-strategist`** — subject statement → adjective pairs →
  visceral/behavioral/reflective sort → top/heart/base note timing and
  the page's single peak moment. One context, one artifact: the
  emotional target spec.
- **`landing-systems`** — the ingredient dial table, the copy voice spec,
  the token system that reconciles them, and the signature element. Owns
  everything that becomes a Tailwind token or a copy rule.
- **`landing-sequencer`** — per-section transition type, weight, spacing,
  beat structure, and copy archetype role (Hero/Problem/Mechanism/Proof/
  Objection/CTA) — the Motion/Lenis pacing spec, plus the taxonomy
  `landing-copywriter` reads to pick its per-section skill, the Builder
  implements against.
- **`landing-headline-writer`** — the headline, plus 2 backups from
  distinct rhetorical mechanisms (via the `landing-copy-headline` skill),
  written to the voice spec. Presented as its own artifact and locked by
  the user before any section's body copy is drafted.
- **`landing-copywriter`** — every section's body text and CTA text, one
  section per invocation, in the sequence's order — each section written
  to its archetype role's dedicated skill and a fixed paragraph-count
  algorithm (one paragraph per beat `landing-sequencer` assigned it),
  to the voice spec, and presented as its own artifact for the user to
  read, edit, and lock before the next section is drafted. Output is
  semantic markdown (paragraph/list/blockquote) so `landing-builder`
  reads section structure directly.
- **`landing-critic`** — the reconciled traceability/distinctiveness
  audit (does every choice, including the headline and every section's
  copy, trace to the subject statement, does anything match a known
  AI-default cluster) and the usability pass (Fitts's Law on the CTA,
  affordance/signifier check). Has veto power; cannot rewrite, only
  redline back to the owning agent.
- **`landing-builder`** — builds the audited spec exactly in Astro,
  placing `landing-headline-writer`'s locked headline and
  `landing-copywriter`'s section copy verbatim, mapping each section's
  markdown structure to the matching markup. Anything that can't be
  built as specified is flagged back up the chain, never silently
  improvised around.
- **Polish Loop** (`landing-executor`, `landing-visual-reviewer`,
  `landing-ux-reviewer`) — runs after `landing-builder`, uncompiled (no
  graph task, no `hedgehog verify` gate). All three work on their own
  editorial judgment, not the chain's generation-time constraints —
  critiquing a finished page is a different instinct than building one
  from a brief. `landing-visual-reviewer` and `landing-ux-reviewer`
  build, screenshot, and interact with the rendered page, redlining
  AI-tell patterns, dead/uneven gaps, scan-pattern and interaction
  friction, and taste, on their own judgment rather than a fixed
  checklist — independent of `landing-critic`'s traceability/usability
  audit, which already ran before the page existed. `landing-executor`
  has full license over the rendered page's markup, styling, and copy
  substance to fix each redline (a rewritten sentence or cut paragraph,
  not just a word swap), bounded only by the locked stack/token system
  and by never touching `.hedgehog/chain/*.md`. Loops until both reviewers return
  clean or 10 iterations pass, one commit per iteration
  (`feat(landing): polish iteration <n>`), then hands off to `tweaker`.

## The constants (do not deviate)

### Stack (locked, every project — no add-ons on this core)

**Astro** (zero-JS-by-default shell, islands only where interaction is
genuinely needed) · **Tailwind v4, CSS-first** (config as token layer
only — no component library on top) · **Motion**, scoped to
CSS/transform targets only, no plugins (primary animation engine; owns
Sequencer pacing and top/heart/base fade timing) · **Lenis**
(smooth-scroll feel, the "weight and suspension" dial) · **SplitType**
(line/word/char copy-reveal splitting) · **Signature element & shape
construction** — the `landing-shapes` skill: geometry personality, the
curve/angular CSS and Canvas 2D technique library, Lucide as the pinned
icon source · **`@fontsource-variable/*`** (self-hosted variable
typefaces, picked per brief at step 5 — never `system-ui`, never an
external font request) · **`astro:assets`** (`<Image />`/`<Picture />`
for every raster image — format conversion, `srcset`, and reserved
space; a bare `<img>` is a defect) · **`ogl`** (lightweight WebGL) or a raw shader (a
continuous background field spanning the full page height, so sections
read as windows onto one surface) · **CSS `clip-path` irregular edges +
`mix-blend-mode` overlap + negative-margin overlap** (section boundary
treatment — breaks the hard horizontal seam between sections without a
new dependency) · **CSS `mask-image` + noise pattern** (texture/grain
layer) · **React Three Fiber** (rare — only when the subject is
genuinely spatial; default is to skip it).

This core has no design-handoff tool. All visual decisions are derived
directly through the Systems Designer's token system (step 5) and the
`landing-shapes` techniques — never imported from an external design
file.

Don't substitute libraries. If a package name changed upstream, verify
against current docs before running — don't swap in a different one, and
don't reach for a component library or a second icon set to fill a gap
one of the above doesn't cover; that gap is a signal to go back to the
Ingredient Vocabulary and derive the right choice, not to default to
something off-the-shelf.

The signature element and every other section shape is always
constructed from a generator, a formula, a measurement, or a sourced
Lucide icon — never hand-typed coordinates. See the `landing-shapes`
skill for the technique.

### Layout

```text
astro.config.mjs     Astro workspace root
src/
  pages/              one file per page (usually just index.astro)
  sections/           one component per page section, in Sequencer order
  shapes/             the signature element + any other section shapes/dividers, built via landing-shapes
  assets/             raster images, imported as modules and rendered through astro:assets `<Image />`
  styles/             global.css — @fontsource-variable imports + Tailwind v4 CSS-first import + the `@theme` token layer (hex values, font families, `--text-*` scale, spacing unit, easing family from Step 5)
.hedgehog/
  hedgehog.db         the build graph — the landing intent, its five compiled tasks, verifications, committed to git
  BMAD/               vendored BMAD-METHOD shelf's raw output (brief, PR-FAQ, PRD, UX spec, research) —
                       write-once, from planner
  chain/              this core's own archival planning intake output — subject statement, adjective tables,
                       token system, signature element spec, sequence spec — write-once, from planner + pipeline agents
docs/
  design/              audited spec (Critic + Usability Auditor reconciled) the Builder builds from
```

### Core rules

- **One page, one job.** The Strategist's subject statement names it;
  every downstream choice traces back to that sentence or gets cut.
- **No agent introduces a choice that doesn't originate in the previous
  agent's output.** A signature element the Systems phase didn't source
  from the subject, a color the Ingredient Director didn't derive from
  an adjective — both get redlined by the Critic, not waved through.
- **Ingredients move in agreement.** Color, type, space, motion, copy
  rhythm, and pacing are one system reconciled at step 5 — a page warm
  in color but cold in type is a defect, not a style choice.
- **Sequential through the pipeline.** A phase starts only once the
  phase before it is checkpointed and committed — steps 4a/4b/4c run in
  parallel (same input), everything else is strictly sequential.
- **One phase = one commit**, in the exact Conventional Commit format
  from `hedgehog-landing-loop`.
- **Fix wrong phases at the source** via the Correction Protocol — never
  a downstream workaround (e.g. don't patch the Builder's output to fix
  a token that's wrong at the Systems Designer's level).
- **The Critic's veto is real.** A traceability or default-cluster
  failure blocks the Builder from starting, the same way a failing gate
  blocks a commit elsewhere in Hedgehog.
